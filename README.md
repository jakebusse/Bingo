## Bingo Labs
Thank you for taking interest in my project! Find below a series of information both about this source code and the statistical analysis project associated with it.

### Source Code
The source code for this project is currently made up of 6 python files

```card.py``` - Creates Bingo cards, displays cards, daubs numbers on cards, and checks cards for a valid BINGO

```game.py``` - Draws/Calls Numbers, Offers UI and Backend playing

```patterns.py``` - Holds a series of common BINGO patterns

```simulate.py``` - Currently allows for simulation to find average number of numbers called before a valid BINGO occurs for a given number of iterations, cards, and specified pattern. Hopefully more simulation models will be added in the future.

```sandbox.py``` - File used solely for testing/debugging code

```data_collect.py``` - Creates CSV files for large-scale simulations (associated with BINGO Labs project)

**To find out more information regarding these files and their functions, please feel free to explore the code**

### Licensing
This code is open source and free to use and modify. Please tag @jakebusse if replicated elsewhere.

### Statistical Analysis Project
I am using this program to run a series of statistical analyses on Bingo games that can be found [here](https://jakebusse.github.io/Bingo).
